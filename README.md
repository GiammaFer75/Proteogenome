# Proteogenome
## A visualising proteomic data software

Proteogenome is a Python module created for viewing proteomic data. These data must be represented by the MS\MS peptides together with their intensity and the ID numbers of the proteins from which they were generated.

The final visualisation of these proteomic data it will be similar to a map. On the top will be the reference genome of a specific organism and below it, will be the peptide and the protein map.
